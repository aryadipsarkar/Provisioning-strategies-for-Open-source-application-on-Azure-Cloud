# Provisioning strategies for Open source application on Azure-Cloud
*Aim of the project* - To discover provisioning strategies that most effectively alleviate decreasing throughputs of
applications deployed on cloud. The testing is done an open source Logicaldoc: Document Management System ( http://www.logicaldoc.com/en.html ). Then investigated the bottlenecks of several functionalities of the application for which the CPU usage gets very high, by using J-Meter stress testing and finally formulated the provisioning strategies for every functionality, by balancing the load at different times of the day,which helped alleviate the performance of the application <br/>
<br/>
LogicalDOC[1] is an enterprise electronic document management system which is extremely
useful for both small and large companies. It is a valuable tool in knowledge management
processing that provides a more flexible and lowercost
alternative to other proprietary
applications.<br/>
<br/>
*PS: The parameters and the methodologies used for testing the application are given in the project report*
